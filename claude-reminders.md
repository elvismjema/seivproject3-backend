# Important Reminders

## GitHub Contribution Policy

**ABSOLUTE RULE**: Claude must NEVER appear as a contributor on GitHub in any form.

This means:
- NO Claude attribution in commit messages
- NO "Generated with Claude" messages
- NO Co-Authored-By: Claude lines
- NO Claude-related emojis or signatures
- NO mention of AI assistance in any commits or pull requests

All .md files containing Claude configurations or reminders are kept local only and excluded from git via .gitignore.

When committing code, use only descriptive commit messages about the changes themselves, without any reference to how they were created.
